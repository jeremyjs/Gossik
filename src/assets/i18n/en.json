It synchronizes with the calendar on your phone and directly displays all entries - regardless if you have created them in Gossik or your calendar app.",
  "infoCalendar2": "Gossik will learn from your entries and can soon suggest you the optimal time slot for a new entry. Also, Gossik will know when you are busy and won’t bother you during these periods.",
  "infoDo1": "This is where the magic happens! Tell Gossik how much time you have available and it will show you the to-do with the highest priority within the selected time. If you have carefully defined your thoughts into actionable next actions, you can really get things done here!",
  "infoDo2": "In case you don’t like a suggested to-do, you can also skip it for now. Additionally, you can click on the list icon to see your entire to-do list instead of just the one with the highest priority. Also, by clicking on the filter icon, you can further narrow down the to-do suggestion for selected projects. As soon as you start a to-do, you will get to the Focus Page (see next section)",
  "infoDo3": "The longer you work with Gossik, the more our algorithms know when to suggest which to-do. Furthermore, Gossik dynamically adjusts the priority of a to-do based on the situation, e.g. when you have a certain deadline approaching or if you are on a plane without access to internet.",
  "infoFocus1": "When you have started a to-do, you will get to the Focus Page. It ensures that you can fully concentrate on the task at hand, without being distracted by other to-dos. As soon as you successfully finish a to-do, you can define a follow-up to-do if necessary (see next section). In case you want to cancel the initiated to-do, we will request you to update the remaining duration, so that we can display it correctly on the Do Page.",
  "infoFocus2": "We also use this page to learn how much time you actually need for your to-dos. This way, Gossik can directly give you a suggestion for the duration of your to-do in the future.",
  "infoFocus3": "Of course, you can always switch to the Thoughts Page at any time to capture a thought.",
  "infoOverview1": "Here you find an overview of all your projects and to-dos that are not assigned to any project. As a sneak-peek, you can see up to 4 to-dos for every project. By clicking on a project, you will get to the individual project overview (see next section).",
  "infoProjectOverview1": "This is the overview page for your project. Here, you will find all your upcoming to-dos and thoughts for this project. By clicking on an entry (to-do or thought), you can view, edit, or delete it. Importantly, the integrated calendar displays only project-specific events.",
  "infoThoughts1": "On this page, you can easily collect all your thoughts and further process them as soon as you have time for it. As a thought, we understand all ideas or inspirations that you don’t want to forget but don’t have time to immediately process.",
  "infoThoughts2": "To increase your focus the most, we recommend to write down your thoughts right when they come up. This way, you can refocus on the task you were doing before and later process all your collected thoughts at once by assigning them as to-dos or attaching them to your projects as thoughts.",
